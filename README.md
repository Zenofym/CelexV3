How to Make Your Own GUI
-----------------------------------------------

To help or to manually update, make a pull request or send a message in Discord. I will test it and add/not add it to the main branch.

The GUI is part of another Github repository: https://github.com/shlexware/Orion

To use it, copy and execute the Universal GUI, and check its compatibility. Remove things that don't work or get flagged by the anti-cheat.

Why use this? It has a lot of working premade things for games. The Tower of Hell and Destruction Simulator scripts were made from the Universal GUI.
